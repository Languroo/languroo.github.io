  <h1>Hi</h1>
    <h2>C-E-R</h2>
    <h3>Claim</h3>
    <p>What’s in the black box is some sort of water filter contraption that allows different amounts of water out whenever you pour a certain amount in.</p>
    <h3>Evidence</h3>
    <p> The mystery black box is a strange contraption, created by Mr Sinusas, that when water is placed inside of the box allows for differing amounts of water to come out.  A key feature of the box is that we cannot see inside the box and that it’s slightly tilted backwards on an angle. Each piece of data was collected using a graduated cylinder.  Using a graduated cylinder for the first test, we input 100ml of water into our version of the black box and it outputted 80ml of water back. Second test we input 100ml of water and got back 75ml. The contraption that my group created was a lever-like system that allowed water inside only if enough pressure was applied to push the lever down. Variance in the amount of water that came out was due to either not enough pressure being applied, or bits of water seeping through the cracks.</p>
    <h3>Reasoning</h3>
    <p>In general models are used to explain things in a visual manner. Usually they help us visualize what we cannot see and gives us more insight on what they could possibly look like. Limitations of models however is that we can never 100% be sure that our model is accurate for some things such as atoms, as we have never seen atoms before. Models also can never be set to scale for the most part as what we are modeling is either too small (DNA) or too large (Solar system). My evidence supports my claim because it showcases data that is representative of how the real black box operates while also giving a different reason as to why water flows the way it is flowing. If there wasn’t a filter contraption like I’m suggesting then the results of our investigations would have been different.  For example, when water was poured in the real mystery black box, differing amounts came out of the box regardless of how much was put inside.</p>
